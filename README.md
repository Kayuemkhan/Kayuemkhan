## About Me

I’m a Mobile Engineer with **5+ years of professional experience** building Android and Flutter applications across **fintech, retail, and food-tech** domains.

I’ve worked on products serving **1M+ users** and systems managing **100K+ active groups**, where performance, stability, and maintainability actually matter—not just feature delivery.

My focus is on:
- clean, readable, and testable code  
- scalable architectures  
- long-term maintainability over short-term hacks  

I strongly believe in **building software right from the start**, which is why I actively practice **Clean Architecture, SOLID principles, and Test-Driven Development (TDD)**.

## How I Think About Engineering

I prioritize correctness, readability, and maintainability over short-term speed.
I prefer fewer abstractions done right rather than complex systems done fast.
